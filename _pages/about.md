Hey there! Welcome on my personal website!

I kicked off my coding adventures when I was just 11, diving into the world of **Minecraft** by crafting mods and plugins using **Java** (I **stopped** java to preserve my mental health). It was a blast! The Minecraft gang and various projects I got involved in over the next five years really helped me level up my skills. I got to play around with **Linux**, dabble in web projects, and team up with some cool graphic designers.

My path led me to decide to leave high school at the end of my first year (seconde), as I didn't feel aligned with the traditional educational system. In July 2017, I joined the **42 pool**, which was an essential formative experience in my development as a developer.

From October 2017 to March 2018, I participated in the **"The Hive"** program organized by [thecamp](https://www.thecamp.fr/), gaining valuable project management experience. Later, in September 2018, I joined the **42 school** to further refine my skills.

Since then, I've embarked on numerous freelance missions across various domains. Most of my freelance work, showcasing a diverse range of projects, can be explored on my [malt.fr profile](https://www.malt.fr/profile/pieerotgg).

As a professional developer today, my primary toolkit includes **Node.JS**, **Typescript**, **Vue.JS**, and **React.JS**. However, in my side projects, where my passion really ignites, I frequently delve into **Rust**, **WebAssembly (WASM)**, and **WebGPU (WGPU)**. Beyond coding, I proficiently use advanced technologies like **Terraform**, **Kubernetes**, **Helm**, **GitHub Actions**, **GitLab CI/CD**, and **ArgoCD**.
